**Paynest Mobile Wallet Application (Pakistan)**

Overview

This project aims to develop a mobile wallet application tailored to the needs of users in Pakistan. It provides essential financial management features, including user registration, wallet balance management, transaction history, and bill payments. Due to the complexities of obtaining an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license from the State Bank of Pakistan, dummy records will be used to demonstrate technical functionality.
